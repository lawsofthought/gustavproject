{T}{he} \emph{hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model} (\hdpmm), when its
mixture components are categorical distributions, is a probabilistic model of
multinomial data. It was first described as part of a more general description
of Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (\hdp) models by \citeA{TehJorBea2004b,teh:JASA},
and is the Bayesian nonparametric generalization of the Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (\lda) model of \citeA{blei03}.  

The aim of this note is to describe in detail a Gibbs sampler for the
\hdpmm when used with multinomial data. This Gibbs sampler is based on of what
was described in \citeA{TehJorBea2004b,teh:JASA} for general \hdp models. However,
as they did not deal in detail with \hdp mixture models for multinomial data,
important details of the sampler required for this particular case were not
described.  On the other hand, \citeA{newman2009distributed} do deal explicitly
with the case of the \hdpmm for multinomial data, and the Gibbs sampler that we
describe here is almost identical to theirs. However, for some
hyper-parameters, \citeA{newman2009distributed} either make simplifying
assumptions or assume that their values are known, which are assumptions that
we do not make here. As such, the sampler we describe here is an extension,
though minor, of that described in \citeA{newman2009distributed}.
