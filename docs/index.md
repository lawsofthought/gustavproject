Gustav is a Probabilistic topic modelling toolbox. So far, only one topic
model, namely a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (HDPMM) is implemented. 

The description of the Gibbs sampler for the HPDMM can be found
[here](http://www.lawsofthought.org/shared/hdpmm.pdf).

The entire code repository, including LaTeX code for documentation, is available [here](https://github.com/lawsofthought/gustavproject).
